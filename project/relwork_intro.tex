There are a number of existing planner applications. However, this project will focus on free applications only. One of the well-known applications is called MyStudyLife. MyStudyLife boasts that it is an app for students, teachers, and lecturers designed to make study life easier to manage. Another existing product is named Trello. Trello is popular in the computer science world and claims to be useful for organizing and prioritizing tasks. WeekPlan is another online planner, slightly different from the previous two as it boasts that it is based on '4 key principles based on best-selling methodologies'. All of these applications will be used for testing in this project's design process.
