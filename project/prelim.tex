The user interviews phase of this project has been completed. The interviews were conducted without a prepared set of questions, but all of them did start with "Do you have a planner?". The goal of user interviews is to find out what the target user's goals are and how they would like a planner to be in a perfect world. After the users were questioned about their uses of planners and past experiences, they were each directed to three different sites; Trello, MyStudyLife, and WeekPlan. The user was directed to login with test account credentials, click around, vocalize their thoughts, and provide an overall opinion. Eight user interviews were conducted on a variety of college students. One student was from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, another was from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, and the rest were from Appalachian State University. Two of the interviewees were graduate students, five were undergraduate students, and one was in a nursing program. Of the undergraduate students, there were two sophomores, one junior, and two seniors. Every one of the subjects used some form of a planner, with three using a digital option, google calendar.
