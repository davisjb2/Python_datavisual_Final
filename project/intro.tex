Keeping up with assignments, tasks, tests, and other goals is critical for college students. 87\% of students say that better time management and organizational skills would improve their grades \cite{relplan}. Many of the students who do engage with planners use a paper planner \cite{mentor}. Why do students who are constantly connected to technology still use pencil and paper to keep track of their school careers? Some applications already exist to serve this purpose, but they have not replaced paper planners. The goal of this project is to conduct user research and usability studies that will uncover the downfalls of current available applications and discover the needs of students. This research will then be used to develop a web application that makes it easy for college students to keep track of their assignments, tests, tasks, and to-do lists.
